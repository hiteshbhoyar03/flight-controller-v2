**Flight Controller Rev2** is a dual-processor, high-performance embedded control system designed for learning and portfolio enhancement purposes. Developed independently, this project demonstrates my skills in embedded systems, PCB design, sensor integration, and flight control logic. All schematics and PCB layouts are completed using Altium Designer, while firmware development is actively progressing in STM32CubeIDE.

> Note: This project is simulation-only and has **not** been fabricated or flight-tested. It serves purely as a design and firmware engineering showcase.

The goal of this project is to simulate the development of a **complete flight control system**, suitable for use in Drones, UAVs or hobby Rockets. It covers the entire hardware-software co-design flow—from schematic and PCB layout to embedded firmware for real-time control, telemetry, and communication protocols.
